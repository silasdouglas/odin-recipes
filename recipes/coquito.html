    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Coquito recipe, a festive Puerto Rican coconut milk punch, is celebrated for its creamy texture and intense
        tropical flavor. The rich base is composed of coconut milk, cream of coconut, and a blend of sweetened condensed
        and evaporated milks, which provide its characteristic sweetness and density. It is flavored with traditional
        spices like cinnamon and cloves, along with vanilla extract, creating a warm flavor profile that perfectly
        complements the white rum.</p>
    <p>The preparation is remarkably simple and efficient, essentially consisting of processing all the liquid
        ingredients and spices in a blender until smooth. Once blended, the drink is transferred to glass bottles and
        kept in the refrigerator. This chilling period is a fundamental step, not just to serve the drink cold, but to
        allow the spices and coconut flavors to meld and intensify before serving.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cans (approx. 15 oz each) coconut milk</li>
        <li>1 can (approx. 15 oz) cream of coconut (e.g., Coco López)</li>
        <li>1 can (approx. 14 oz) sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 can (approx. 12 oz) evaporated milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white rum (or to taste)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Combine ingredients:</strong> In the container of a blender, combine the coconut milk, cream of
            coconut, sweetened condensed milk, and evaporated milk.</li>
        <li><strong>Add flavors:</strong> Add the white rum, vanilla extract, ground cinnamon, and ground cloves to the
            milk mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Process:</strong> Cover and blend on high speed until the mixture is completely integrated and
            smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Bottle:</strong> Pour the mixture into clean glass bottles.</li>
        <li><strong>Refrigerate:</strong> Place the bottles in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours (or overnight) to
            allow the flavors to develop and the drink to chill thoroughly.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Shake the bottle well before serving, as the ingredients may naturally separate.
            Serve in small glasses and garnish with a sprinkle of cinnamon if desired.</li>
    </ol>
