    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Allrecipes Panna Cotta recipe focuses on simplicity, using only five basic ingredients: milk, unflavored
        gelatin, heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla extract. The process begins by hydrating the gelatin in the milk while
        the cream and sugar are heated together until they reach a boil. Once boiling, the gelatin mixture is stirred in
        until completely dissolved, finishing with the addition of vanilla off the heat to preserve its aroma.</p>
    <p>After preparation, the cream is poured into individual ramekins and allowed to cool at room temperature for about
        20 minutes. The final and crucial step is refrigeration, which must last at least 4 hours (though overnight is
        preferred) to ensure the characteristic velvety texture. The result is a classic Italian dessert, light and
        versatile, which can be served plain or topped with chocolate sauce or fresh fruit.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 envelope unflavored gelatin (approximately 7g or 2 ¼ teaspoons)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cold milk</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/3 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Hydrate the gelatin:</strong> In a small bowl, pour the cold milk and sprinkle the gelatin over the
            top. Set aside and let it rest for about 1 to 2 minutes to hydrate.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the cream:</strong> In a medium saucepan, stir together the heavy cream and sugar. Place over
            medium heat and stir constantly until the mixture reaches a boil (be careful not to let it boil over).</li>
        <li><strong>Incorporate the gelatin:</strong> As soon as it boils, immediately add the hydrated gelatin mixture
            to the saucepan. Stir vigorously until the gelatin is completely dissolved and incorporated into the cream.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Finish and cool:</strong> Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Mix
            well. Let the mixture cool in the pan for about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Distribute:</strong> Pour the cream into individual molds or ramekins.</li>
        <li><strong>Refrigerate:</strong> Place in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours. Ideally, let it rest overnight
            so the consistency is perfect before unmolding or serving.</li>
    </ol>
