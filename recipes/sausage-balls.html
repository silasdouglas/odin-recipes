    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These Sausage Balls are a classic and straightforward appetizer, perfect for gatherings, requiring only three
        main ingredients: raw pork sausage, biscuit baking mix, and shredded sharp Cheddar cheese. The preparation
        emphasizes texture, as the fat from the sausage and the melted cheese blend with the baking mix to create
        savory, slightly spicy bite-sized spheres. The key to success is ensuring the cheese and sausage are thoroughly
        incorporated into the dough before shaping the balls.</p>
    <p>The baking process is quick, taking about 20 to 25 minutes in the oven until they are golden brown and cooked
        through. A notable tip from the recipe is to avoid pre-shredded packaged cheese, opting instead to grate a block
        of cheese fresh for better binding and moisture. Once baked, these balls can be served warm or at room
        temperature, making them a versatile option that can be prepared in advance and even frozen for later use.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground pork sausage</li>
        <li>2 cups biscuit baking mix (such as Bisquick)</li>
        <li>1 pound sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Lightly grease a baking sheet or line it
            with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the raw sausage, biscuit mix, and shredded
            cheese. Use your hands or a heavy-duty mixer to blend them until a consistent dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the balls:</strong> Scoop small amounts of the mixture and roll them into 1-inch balls.</li>
        <li><strong>Arrange:</strong> Place the balls on the prepared baking sheet, leaving about an inch of space
            between them.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until they are golden brown and
            the sausage is fully cooked.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Remove from the oven and serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
